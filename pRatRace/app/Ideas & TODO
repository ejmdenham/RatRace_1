List of things need to test:

Map showing markers of player(s)
    Backend gateway to add races/quests
        °°°A schema for quests
Teams
    A way to form temp. teams for quests
    Chat option for teams

-The should be a quests menu with a list of available quests
    Each quest should have the following info (eventually) (-quick view, +expanded view)
        -name
        -when the quest will begin in mm/dd/yy (assuming the min # of teams sign up)
        -difficulty of the quest
        -min and max number of teams
        -min and max team size
        +a short description of the quest
        +a map showing the coverage

-Quest types
    Headhunter - [Several] Small teams or single players (1 - 3)
        The object of the game is to collect bounties from other players.
        You collect their bounties by coming within a certain (small) distance to them.
        Players will know their mark and know which team is marking them.
        As the game progresses "power-ups" rain down over the area which will give
            a permanent bonus to the person, team, or teams that are standing in the area
            after an activation time.
            (the more players from the same team the stronger the power-up becomes)
            It will also be possible for more than 1 team to get a bonus from a power
            zone if they show up around the same time.
        Teams can always see their predator (who is hunting them)  as well as their mark.
        In certain circumstances they could have no or multiple marks. (eg. when performing poorly)
        In certain circumstances they could have no or multiple predators. (eg. when performing well)

Things to implement eventually:
    Skill tree/nodes - skills that players can unlock as they level up as well as a
        unique skill.

        Unique Skill - when players open the skill tree for the first time they'll be asked
            a series of questions
